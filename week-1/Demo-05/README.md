# Lab 5a 

## Instructions

You are being given starter code for today, in the `index.html` and `app.js` files inside of this directory. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in the `tests.js` file. You do not need to do anything with `tests.js`, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* [X]Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into *main* on GitHub (and then pull back into main on your laptop!) when the problem is completed.[X] Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the updated main branch from GitHub into your local main branch each time you merge a pull request, then make a new branch from main for the next problem.
* [X]Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function.[X] Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
