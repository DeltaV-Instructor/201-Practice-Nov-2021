# Assignment Overview: Lab 10

[X]You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment. 

## Instructions

[X]It is your job to create a page that looks ***exactly*** like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today's directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image. 

[X]Create a new repository for today called **chocolate-pizza**. Follow the pair programming work flow by having one [X]user fork the other so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent commits, and [X]always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before [X]writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:
[X]- When should you focus on styling?
[X]- When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?
[X]- When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?
[X]- When you should you add JS? Do you even add JS?

[X]***Don't forget to "swap" driver and navigator 2 hours into the challenge***.

Suggestion: Set up your work directory like this:

[X]* index.html
[X]* style.css
[X]* app.js *(if you choose to use JS)*
[X]* img/   *(a directory that contains all of your image assets)*

If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.

### Stretch Goals

After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further by implementing some or all of the following into your application:
1. Add some JavaScript to your page.
   - Make the checkboxes actually check using JavaScript!
1. Refactor your code and optimize it further.
