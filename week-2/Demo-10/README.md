[x] 1. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
[x] 1. Specified different font colors for all three font usages
[x] 1. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
[x] 1. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
[x] 1. Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity,  and consistency are good things in design.
[x] 1. Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
[x] 1. Include all of the typical stuff that you'll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, phone number, email address, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
