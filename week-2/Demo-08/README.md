# Demo 08a
## Instructions

[X] Create a new repo titled 'wirefame-exercise', making sure to configure it with 
[X] `index.html`, 
[X] `style.css`, 
[X] and `reset.css` 
[X] (use [Eric Meyer's reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset){:target="_blank"}).

[X]hahaha. ahh.. Consider taking a more professional approach to web development by planning out your approach before jumping into code.

1. Have a design concept and a plan completely ready to go before you write the first line of code.
    [X] - Build/Review a wireframe showing all document dimensions
    [X] - Know where images will go and how big they will be
    [X] - Use placeholder images during the setup process
    [X] - Know where text will go and use placeholder *lorem ipsum* text
[X] 1. Set up the project repository, scaffold the files, and make sure they are wired together.
[X] 1. Build out all of the HTML without applying any classes or IDs
[X] 1. Working top to bottom in the document, put elements into place with CSS, using the structure of the HTML to create selectors wherever it is possible. Seek to limit use of classes and IDs to only where they are needed.
[X] 1. Apply color, backgrounds, borders, text styling, etc., to the specifications of the design.

[X] After each step, be sure to "ACP" within your git work-flow. 

[X]With this wireframe in place, you can now present it to the designer and/or client for review, make any requested [X]edits, and once there is a signoff on the wireframe, then it is time to start entering the actual content.


# Lab08b
## Instructions

[X]Continue working on the functionality of your `sales.html` page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including [X]the row of totals across the bottom.

[X]Pat has provided you 7 additional images that they would like to see on the home page of the site. These images are [X]located in your daily class GitHub repo: `class-08/lab-b/assets/`.

[X]Your public-facing **index.html** page should include the following:

  [X]1. locations with addresses,
  [X]1. hours open
  [X]1. contact information
  [X]1. Anything else you feel neccesary.
  [X]1. A link to your `sales.html` page
  [X] - Be sure to also include a link to your `index.html` page on your `sales.html` pages as well.

[X]Feel free to make this information up. Get creative, have fun, but remember to be professional.

### Stretch Goals

- Add the ability for your users to choose among multiple display or color profiles for the page. Clicking a button should allow them to choose (for instance) whether the text is dark on a light background, or the text is light on a dark background. You can also experiment with changing up the style: make a version of your display that mimics a newspaper, or an Excel spreadsheet, or Roman chiseling in stone. (But make sure the user can choose a more normal style, too!) You can also experiment with using a `select` input to choose the style.

[bad link not sure if we are still using it.]- Make a style guide, using [this one that a team Brian was on made for Everlast](http://everlast.com/style-guide) as a model.

[X] - Make two additional pages:
  - Mock up an order form that would be public facing (**store.html**) so that visitors to the website can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you'd expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
  - A second 'private' page (**order-processing.html**) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a 'Filled Orders' list at the bottom of the page.
